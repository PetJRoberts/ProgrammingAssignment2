## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## These functions follow similarly the framework described in the
## Caching the Mean of the Vector example

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function checks to see if there exists a cached version of the inverse
## of the matrix x
## If there is the inverse is returned
## If not the inverse of the matrix is found and returned

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
